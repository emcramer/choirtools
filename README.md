# choirtools

The goal of choirtools is to provide a set of tools for cleaning and analyzing data from the Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry data base run by the Stanford Pain Clinic. No actual data from the data base is provided in this package. A simulated sample is included for examples and demos.

## To Install `choirtools`

```r
devtools::install_github("ericscrum/devtools")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to convert mislabeled female bodymaps to a standard for mixed gender analysis (such as examining differences in segment endorsements between men and women).


```r
## basic example code

# load example data

# isolate rows of female patients

# convert the female bodymaps to a standard

# amend the imported data set with the fixed female records

```
